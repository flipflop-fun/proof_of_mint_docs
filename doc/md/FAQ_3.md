# FAQ of flipflop.plus III

## C. Minting Process

### C4. Can I Use My Own Generated URC Code?
The system restricts using your own URC code for minting.

---

### C5. How to Calculate the Cost of Minted Tokens?
The minting cost on flipflop.plus is calculated in real-time using a **dynamic algorithm model**. The core formulas and parameters are as follows:

#### 1. Core Formulas
**Per-token cost for a single mint**:
$$
p = \frac{P_0 \cdot d}{M_0 \cdot f^{(m-1)}}
$$

**Total minting cost** (to complete the target Milestone):
$$
\text{TotalCost} = \frac{P_0 \cdot T_0}{M_0} \cdot \sum_{i=1}^{C_e} d_i
$$

**Parameter Definitions**:
| Symbol | Definition | Example (Standard Mode) |
|--------|----------------------------|------------------------|
| $P_0$ | Fixed fee per mint | 0.2 SOL |
| $d$ | Current FOMO coefficient (difficulty factor) | Starts at 1, increases with rapid minting |
| $M_0$ | Base mint amount per transaction | 10,000 tokens |
| $f$ | Milestone decay factor | 0.5 (Standard Mode) |
| $m$ | Current Milestone number | 1 (first Milestone) |
| $T_0$ | Target mint amount per Checkpoint | 200,000 tokens |
| $C_e$ | Total number of Checkpoints (target Milestone) | 250 |

#### 2. Step-by-Step Calculation Examples (Standard Mode)
##### Scenario 1: Minting at Target Speed ($d=1$)
- **Single mint cost**:
  $$
  p = \frac{0.2 \cdot 1}{10,000 \cdot 0.5^{0}} = \frac{0.2}{10,000} = 0.00002 \ \text{SOL/token}
  $$
- **Total cost**:
  $$
  \text{TotalCost} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 200,000}{10,000} \cdot 250 \cdot 1 = 4 \cdot 250 = 1,000 \ \text{SOL}
  $$

##### Scenario 2: Rapid Minting ($d$ increases to 1.5)
- **Single mint cost**:
  $$
  p = \frac{0.2 \cdot 1.5}{10,000 \cdot 0.5^{0}} = 0.00003 \ \text{SOL/token}
  $$
- **Total cost**:
  $$
  \text{TotalCost} = 4 \cdot 250 \cdot 1.5 = 1,500 \ \text{SOL}
  $$

#### 3. Key Factors Affecting Costs
| Factor | Impact on Cost | Example |
|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Minting Speed** | Faster speed → $d$ increases → Higher cost | 50% speed increase → 50% cost increase |
| **Milestone Decay** | New Milestone → $M_0$ decreases → Exponential cost increase | 2nd Milestone cost ×2 ($f=0.5$) |

### C6. How to Find All My Minted Tokens?
In the flipflop.plus app, navigate to **Menu → My Minted Tokens** to view all your minted tokens.

---

## D. Unique Referral Code (URC)

### D1. How to Generate a URC Referral Code?
In the flipflop.plus app:
1. Go to the token page.
2. Click the purple **"Generate URC"** button.
3. Sign with your connected wallet to generate the URC code.

If the code is already generated, you can:
- Check the number of times the code has been used.
- Access a unique referral link to share with the community, allowing direct minting without entering the URC code.

If the code reaches its usage limit (50 times), click the **"Activate"** button to reactivate it. Note: There must be a **minimum 24-hour interval** between activations.

---

### D2. What Are the Benefits of URC?
Users who mint with a URC and referrers who promote URCs can gain **direct and indirect benefits** as outlined below.

---

### D3. Benefits and Calculation Formulas for URC Referrers and Users

#### 1. Benefits for Referrers (URC Providers)
- **Reward Mechanism**: Referrers earn **20%** of the fee savings generated by referred users.
- **Formula**:
  $$
  \text{Referrer Reward} = 0.2 \cdot (P_0 - \text{Fee}) = 0.2 \cdot P_0 \cdot k \cdot \left(1 - \frac{1}{d}\right)
  $$
  - $P_0$: Fixed minting fee
  - $k$: Discount rate (determined by referrer’s token holding ratio)
  - $d$: Current FOMO coefficient (difficulty factor)

#### 2. Benefits for Referred Users (URC Users)
- **Fee Discount**: Users enjoy a **0%–25%** discount on minting fees based on the referrer’s token holding ratio.
- **Formula**:
  $$
  \text{Actual Fee} = P_0 \cdot \left(1 + \frac{k}{d} - k\right)
  $$
- Discount rate $k$ is determined by the referrer’s token holding ratio $r$:
  $$
  k =
  \begin{cases}
  0\% & r < 0.2\% \\
  5\% & 0.2\% \leq r < 0.4\% \\
  10\% & 0.4\% \leq r < 0.6\% \\
  15\% & 0.6\% \leq r < 0.8\% \\
  20\% & 0.8\% \leq r < 1\% \\
  25\% & r \geq 1\%
  \end{cases}
  $$

#### 3. Example Calculation
**Parameters**:
- Fixed minting fee: $P_0 = 0.1\ \text{ETH}$
- Referrer’s token holding ratio: $r = 0.5\%$ (corresponding to $k = 10\%$)
- Current difficulty factor: $d = 1.2$

**Step 1: Calculate Referred User’s Actual Fee**:
$$
\text{Fee} = 0.1 \cdot \left(1 + \frac{0.1}{1.2} - 0.1\right) = 0.1 \cdot (1 + 0.0833 - 0.1) = 0.1 \cdot 0.9833 = 0.09833\ \text{ETH}
$$
- **Fee Savings**:
  $$
  P_0 - \text{Fee} = 0.1 - 0.09833 = 0.00167\ \text{ETH}
  $$

**Step 2: Calculate Referrer’s Reward**:
$$
\text{Referrer Reward} = 0.2 \cdot 0.00167 = 0.000334\ \text{ETH}
$$

#### 4. Comparison Across Scenarios
| Scenario | Difficulty ($d$) | Discount Rate ($k$) | Actual Fee (ETH) | Referrer Reward (ETH) |
|------------------|------------------|--------------------|------------------|----------------------|
| No Discount ($k=0\%$) | 1.2 | 0% | 0 | 0 (no reward without discount) |
| Standard Example | 1.2 | 10% | 0.09833 | 0.000334 |
| High Difficulty ($d=2.0$) | 2.0 | 10% | 0.1*(1+0.1/2-0.1)=0.095 | 0.2*(0.1-0.095)=0.001 |
| Max Discount ($k=25\%$) | 1.0 | 25% | 0.1*(1+0.25/1-0.25)=0.1 | 0 (no reward without difficulty) |
| Extreme Difficulty ($d=100.0$) | 100.0 | 25% | 0.1*(1+0.25/100-0.25)=0.07525 | 0.2*(0.1-0.07525)=0.00495 |

#### 5. Conclusions
**5.1. Referrer Benefits**:
- Rewards are positively correlated with **fee savings**. Higher $d$ leads to greater savings (e.g., $d=2.0$ increases reward to 0.001 ETH).
- Holding more tokens (higher $k$) significantly boosts rewards (e.g., $k=25\%$ yields higher reward ceilings).

**5.2. Referred User Benefits**:
- Savings depend on the **ratio of $k$ to $d$**. Higher difficulty enhances discount effectiveness (e.g., $d=2.0$ saves 5%).
- At $d=1.0$ (no difficulty increase), even max discount ($k=25\%$) yields no savings; dynamic difficulty is required.

#### 6. Design Purpose
**6.1. Win-Win Design**:
- Referrers gain **continuous income** (rewards per mint), incentivizing community growth.
- Referred users benefit from **cost optimization**, especially during high-difficulty phases (e.g., market frenzy).

**6.2. Community-Driven Growth**:
- **Encourages Holding**: Higher holding ratios increase discount appeal, motivating referrers to hold rather than sell.
- **Boosts Consensus**: URC promoters expand the community by attracting more minters, strengthening token consensus value.
- **Positive Feedback Loop**: More community members increase token demand, enhancing price stability and referrer holding value.

**6.3. Offsets FOMO-Driven Cost Increases**:
- Rapid minting raises the FOMO coefficient ($d$), increasing per-token costs. URC discounts mitigate this, encouraging community engagement.

**6.4. Permissionless Promotion Mechanism**:
- **On-Chain Operation**: URC runs entirely on smart contracts, requiring no centralized approval, allowing promoters to build sub-communities freely.
- **Low Entry Barrier**: Any user can generate and promote URCs, with transparent and instant reward settlement.
- **Automated Calculation**: Discounts and rewards are determined solely by holding ratio, preventing manual manipulation.

#### 7. Summary
The URC mechanism combines **on-chain algorithms** with community promotion and dynamic cost control to achieve:
1. **Economic Incentives**: Promoter rewards correlate with holdings and market heat, creating a sustainable growth flywheel.
2. **Fairness Assurance**: Discounts are determined solely by holding ratio, preventing manipulation.
3. **Volatility Resistance**: Discounts offset cost spikes in high-difficulty phases, maintaining user engagement.
4. **Decentralized Governance**: Relies entirely on code, eliminating intermediary trust, aligning with Web3 ethos.

This mechanism is the first decentralized solution to deeply integrate **holding benefits** with **community promotion**, offering a novel paradigm for token economic models.

---

### D4. How Does URC Impact Total Minting Fees at Graduation?
#### 1. Core Mechanism Formulas
The URC mechanism adjusts net minting fees through dual regulation:
- **Referred User**: Pays reduced fees (Formula: $\text{Fee} = P_0 \cdot (1 + \frac{k}{d} - k)$).
- **Referrer**: Receives 20% of fee savings (Formula: $0.2 \cdot P_0 \cdot k \cdot (1 - \frac{1}{d})$).
- **System Net Impact**: Net revenue per URC mint:
  $$
  \text{NetFee} = \text{Fee} - \text{Referrer Reward} = P_0 \cdot \left(1 - 1.2k + \frac{1.2k}{d}\right)
  $$
  Where:
  - $P_0$: Fixed minting fee (Standard=0.2 SOL, Meme=0.01 SOL)
  - $k$: Discount rate (0%–25%)
  - $d$: FOMO coefficient (difficulty factor)

#### 2. Impact on Total Minting Fees
Original total minting fee range (without URC):
$$
\text{TotalFee} \in \left[ \frac{P_0 T_0}{M_0} C_e,\ \frac{P_0 T_0}{M_0} \cdot 101 \cdot (1.01^{C_e} - 1) \right]
$$
With URC, replace $P_0$ with $\text{NetFee}$, adjusting the range to:
$$
\text{TotalFee}_{\text{URC}} \in \left[ \frac{P_0 (1 - 1.2k + \frac{1.2k}{d}) T_0}{M_0} C_e,\ \frac{P_0 (1 - 1.2k + \frac{1.2k}{d}) T_0}{M_0} \cdot 101 \cdot (1.01^{C_e} - 1) \right]
$$

#### 3. Parameter Comparison for Two Modes
| Parameter | Standard Mode | Meme Mode |
|----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Single Mint Fee ($P_0$) | 0.2 SOL | 0.01 SOL |
| Target Mint Amount ($T_0$) | 200,000 tokens | 1,000,000 tokens |
| Base Mint Amount ($M_0$) | 10,000 tokens | 10,000 tokens |
| Number of Checkpoints ($C_e$) | 250 | 250 |
| Original Fee Range | [1,000, 4,457] SOL | [250, 1,114.25] SOL |

#### 4. Extreme Scenario Calculation ($k=25\%$, $d→∞$)
When $k=25\%$ and $d→∞$, the total minting fee range becomes:
$$
\text{TotalFee}_{\text{URC}} \in \left[ 0.7 \cdot \frac{P_0 T_0}{M_0} C_e,\ 0.7 \cdot \frac{P_0 T_0}{M_0} \cdot 101 \cdot (1.01^{C_e} - 1) \right]
$$

##### 4.1 Standard Mode
- Net fee:
  $$
  \text{NetFee} = P_0 \times (1 - 1.2k) = 0.2 \times (1 - 1.2 \times 0.25) = 0.14\ \text{SOL}
  $$
- Liquidity pool impact: 30% SOL reduction, (0.2 - 0.14) / 0.2 = 30%
- Total minting fee range:
  $$
  [0.7 \times 1,000,\ 0.7 \times 4,457] = [700,\ 3,119.9]\ \text{SOL}
  $$

##### 4.2 Meme Mode
- Net fee:
  $$
  \text{NetFee} = 0.01 \times 0.7 = 0.007\ \text{SOL}
  $$
- Liquidity pool impact: 30% reduction
- Total minting fee range:
  $$
  [0.7 \times 250,\ 0.7 \times 1,114.25] = [175,\ 780]\ \text{SOL}
  $$

#### 5. Economic Impact Comparison in Extreme Scenarios
| Impact Dimension | Standard Mode | Meme Mode |
|------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| Single Net Revenue | 0.2→0.14 SOL (-30%) | 0.01→0.007 SOL (-30%) |
| Total Fee Upper Limit | 4,457→3,119.9 SOL | 1,114.25→780 SOL |
| Total Fee Lower Limit | 1,000→700 SOL | 250→175 SOL |
| Referrer Reward per Mint | 0.01 SOL | 0.0005 SOL |

#### 6. Community Growth Compensation
- Assuming URCs attract 100% more participants, the actual liquidity pool size becomes:
  $$
  \text{ActualLP} = 0.7 \times 2 = 1.4 \times \text{Original Value}
  $$

#### 7. Conclusion
In extreme cases, the URC mechanism reduces the total fee range by **up to 30%** in both modes, but this is mitigated by:
1. Increased transaction volume from community growth.
2. Differentiated mode designs to balance incentives.

This results in **controlled cost redistribution** (from liquidity pool to community incentives) rather than systemic risk. Continuous monitoring of $k$ and $d$ distributions is recommended, with parameter adjustments if necessary.

**Summary**: The URC mechanism reduces net minting revenue through **fee redistribution** (discounts + rewards), shrinking the total fee range at graduation by **0–30%** (depending on $k$ and $d$ distributions). This design sacrifices some initial liquidity to achieve faster community bootstrapping and long-term ecosystem vitality, embodying a **short-term cost for long-term growth** strategy.

### D5. Are All URCs the Same? What Are the Differences?
#### 1. Core Difference Dimensions
The key distinctions between URCs are:

| Dimension | Influencing Factor | Variable Range | Smart Contract Control |
|-----------|---------------------|----------------|-----------------------|
| **Discount Strength** | Referrer’s holding ratio ($r$) | 0%–25% | Automatically calculated via real-time holding queries |
| **Reward Share** | Platform governance rules | Fixed 20% share | Immutable smart contract constant |

#### 2. Economic Value Difference Formula
The economic value (EV) of a single URC can be quantified as:
$$
EV = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left[ \frac{0.2P_0k_i(1-\frac{1}{d_i})}{(1+s)^t} \right]
$$
Where:
- $k_i$ = min(25%, Referrer’s holdings / Current circulation)
- $s$ = Risk discount rate (recommended 15%)
- $t$ = Time cycle of minting

#### 3. Typical URC Type Comparison
| URC Type | Holding Ratio | Discount Rate | Daily Usage Limit | Estimated Revenue (Standard Mode) |
|----------|---------------|---------------|-------------------|--------------------------|
| Whale URC | ≥1% | 25% | 50 times | 18–22 SOL/day |
| Community Leader URC | 0.6–0.8% | 15% | 50 times | 3–5 SOL/day |
| Retail URC | 0.2–0.4% | 5% | 50 times | 0.1–0.3 SOL/day |
| System Default URC | 0% | 0% | 50 times | 0 SOL |

#### 4. Impact on Participants
**For Minters**:
- High-discount URCs save:
  - Up to 25% fees (0.05 SOL/mint when $d→∞$)
  - Typically 3–8% savings (average $d≈1.5$)

**For Referrers**:
- Revenue depends on:
  - Holding volume (determines $k$)
  - Promotion capability (affects usage frequency)
  - Market enthusiasm (impacts $d$)

---

### D6. How to Obtain High-Quality URCs?
#### 1. Increase Token Holdings
- Boost token balance in your wallet to elevate URC discount tier ($k$ value).
- Holding ratio ≥1% unlocks the maximum 25% discount privilege.

#### 2. Community Engagement
- Monitor community updates in real-time to snag URCs from high-holding users.
- Participate in project AMAs, testnet activities, etc., to access exclusive URCs.

#### 3. Join Whale Sub-Communities
- Join exclusive groups of high-holding users via Discord/Telegram.
- Access stable, high-discount URCs (often requires staking a certain token amount).

#### 4. On-Chain Monitoring
- Use blockchain explorers to track large holding addresses.
- Set transaction alerts to capture premium URC generation transactions.

#### 5. Timing Strategy
- Acquire cost-effective URCs during market lulls (lower $d$ values).
- URC quality is generally higher in early project stages.

---

### D7. Can I Generate and Promote URCs Before a Future Token Launch?
- **Pre-Launch URC Generation**: Project teams can generate valid URCs at any time before the token launch (T0).
- **Pre-Launch Characteristics**:
  - URCs can be distributed and promoted normally.
  - Minting functionality remains locked until the launch time, when it unlocks automatically.

---

### D8. Why Did My Shared URC Expire?
#### 1. Core Reasons for URC Expiration
- **Usage Limit Exhausted**: Each URC has a default limit of 50 uses.
- **Time Lock Restriction**: Reactivation requires a ≥24-hour interval.

#### 2. Anti-Abuse Design Principles
| Mechanism | Technical Implementation | Protection Effect |
|-----------|--------------------------|-------------------|
| Usage Limit (50 times) | Smart contract counter | Prevents unlimited URC abuse |
| 24-Hour Cooldown | Timestamp verification (Solana Slot calculation) | Suppresses bot-driven high-frequency URC generation |
| Unique Identifier | PDA account binding | Ensures independent URC counting |

#### 3. On-Chain Verification Methods
Users can check via the app or Solana explorer:
- Remaining usage count
- Next reactivation time

---

### D9. Are URCs the Same for the Same Referrer Across Different Projects?
#### 1. URC Core Generation Mechanism
- **Base Components**:
  ```math
  \text{URC}_{\text{default}} = \text{TokenSymbol} \oplus \text{Shorten}(\text{ReferrerPubkey})
  ```
  Where:
  - $\oplus$ denotes the connector "_"
  - $\text{Shorten}()$ takes the first and last 8 characters of the public key

- **Example**:
  ```python
  # Input
  token = "SATO"
  pubkey = "5UtbDq2jGZF9DQJ71VoeGVRd85DRRosmNWxhoPY9tgNi"
  
  # Output
  URC_default = "SATO_5UtbDq2joPY9tgNi"  # First 8 + last 8 characters
  ```

#### 2. Custom URC Rules
| Type | Character Limit | Uniqueness Scope | Example |
|------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Default URC | Fixed format | Chain-wide | SATO_5UtbD...tgNi |
| Custom URC | 3–24 characters (alphanumeric) | Within same token project | SATO_ToTheMoon |

#### 3. Cross-Project URC Characteristics
- **Fully Independent**:
  - A referrer’s URCs for different projects are distinct and do not affect each other.
  - Each URC is bound to a specific token contract address.

#### 4. Key Considerations
1. Custom URCs cannot include:
   - Special symbols (except "_")
   - Recommended to retain token symbol as prefix (e.g., "SATO_")

---

### D10. How to Find and Manage My Promoted Tokens?
To manage promoted tokens, flipflop.plus offers the **My URC** feature. In the app, navigate to: **Menu → Tools → My URC** to view all promoted tokens.

---

### D11. How to Check URC Code Details (Validity, Discount, Usage Count, Next Activation Time)?
In the app, go to: **Menu → Tools → Validate URC**, enter the URC code, and verify its validity and minting discount.

---

### D12. How to Check How Many People Used My URC and My Earned Rewards?
In the app, navigate to: **Menu → Tools → My URC**, select a promoted token, and click **Bonus Detail**.

---

### D13. If Someone Using My URC Refunds, Will My Earned Commission Be Deducted?
#### 1. Core Rules
- **Commission Protection**: Referrer rewards are not reclaimed.
- **Refund Deduction Source**: The referrer’s reward is deducted from the refund applicant’s principal.

#### 2. Funds Flow Model
```math
\begin{aligned}
&\text{RefundAmount} = \text{MintFee} - \text{RewardFee} - \text{RefundFee} \\
\end{aligned}
```
If no discount URC was used during minting, no RewardFee is deducted.

---

### D14. How to Share a Token I Like (Twitter, Image, Link)?
On the token page, click the **Share** button in the top-right corner. Choose from three sharing options:
- Copy the referral link.
- Share to Twitter (X).
- Generate a shareable image containing token details and a QR code for the referral link.

---

### D15. What Should I Do If I Receive a Friend’s Promo Image?
Scan the QR code in the bottom-right corner of the image with your phone to access the token page and start minting.

---

## E. Refunds

### E1. How to Refund?
In the app, go to: **Menu → Tools → My Minted Tokens**, select a minted token, and click the **Refund** button to initiate a refund.

---

### E2. How Are Refund Fees Calculated? How Much Will I Receive After Refunding?
#### 1. Refund Fee Calculation
Refund fees consist of two components:
- **Refund Fee**: Fixed at **5%** of the refunded amount.
- **URC Reward Return** (if a referral code was used): Deducts the referrer’s earned reward.

**Calculation Formula**:
```math
\text{RefundAmount} = \text{MintFee} - \text{RewardFee} - \text{RefundFee}
```
Where:
- `MintFee`: Initial minting fee paid by the user (e.g., 0.1 SOL), cumulative for multiple mints.
- `RewardFee`: Referrer’s cumulative reward from URC usage during minting (0 if no URC used).
- `RefundFee`: Refund processing fee, 5% of `MintFee`, charged by the platform.

**Examples**:
- User paid 0.1 SOL, no URC:
  - Refund amount = `0.1 SOL - 0 - (0.1 × 5%) = 0.095 SOL`
- User paid 0.1 SOL, URC with 0.001 SOL referrer reward:
  - Refund amount = `0.1 SOL - 0.001 SOL - (0.1 × 5%) = 0.094 SOL`

#### 2. Fund Return Process
- **Returned Amount**: User receives the net amount after deductions (per formula).
- **Token Handling**: Refunded tokens are **immediately burned**, reducing the total token supply.
- **Restrictions**:
  - Wallet token balance must **exactly match** the minted amount, or refund fails.
  - Refunds are only available during the **consensus period** (before target Milestone completion).

---

### E3. Are Refunds Always Available Throughout a Token’s Lifecycle?
Refunds are only valid during the **consensus period** (before the target Milestone is reached).

---

### E4. Where Do Refunded Tokens Go? Do They Reduce the Total Supply?
Refunded tokens are **immediately burned**, thus reducing the total token supply.

---

### E5. What If I Get a Refund Error Saying My Token Balance Doesn’t Match the Minted Amount?
For a refund, your wallet’s token balance must exactly match the minted amount. If mismatched:
- Acquire additional tokens to match the minted quantity.
- Tokens not obtained via minting cannot be refunded.

---

## F. Graduation and Market Value Growth

### F1. Can Anyone Add Liquidity During the Consensus Period? Are Tokens Tradable?
Per flipflop.plus’s mechanism, the rules for liquidity and trading during the consensus period are:

#### 1. Token Transfers
- **Allowed**: Tokens can be freely transferred after minting begins (transfer functionality opens upon token issuance).
- **Technical Basis**: Tokens follow Solana’s SPL standard, supporting transfers by default unless restricted (flipflop.plus imposes no such restrictions).

#### 2. Liquidity Addition
- **Open**: Any user (project team or community members) can create liquidity pools on DEXs like Raydium.
- **Risk Warnings**:
  - Token prices are highly volatile during the consensus period due to lack of official liquidity support, risking high slippage or low depth.
  - Official liquidity pools (funded by Token Vault) are only injected **after target Milestone completion** by the issuer or Value Manager (VM).

#### 3. Trading Feasibility
- **Tradable but Risky**: Tokens can be bought/sold, but trading relies on community-driven liquidity, which may face:
  - Price manipulation (e.g., whale dumps causing crashes).
  - Insufficient liquidity leading to failed transactions.

#### 4. Official Recommendation
- Project teams advise waiting until **target Milestone completion** for trading via official liquidity pools for a more stable market environment.

**Summary**:
- **✅ Yes**: Anyone can add liquidity or trade during the consensus period.
- **⚠️ Caution**: Non-official pools carry high risks; proceed carefully.
- **Official Liquidity**: Professional liquidity management, backed by Token Vault funds, begins after target Milestone completion.

---

### F2. Which DEX Pools Does flipflop.plus Support?
flipflop.plus **supports all Solana ecosystem DEXs**, with primary optimization for **Raydium** and an automated pool creation mechanism. Details:

#### 1. Supported DEXs
✅ **All Solana DEXs allow free liquidity addition**, including but not limited to:
- **Raydium** (supports latest CPMM protocol, cp-swap)
- **Orca**
- **Jupiter** (aggregator, relies on underlying DEXs)
- **Saber** (stablecoin AMM)
- **Mercurial**
- **Lifinity**
- **Other Solana AMM protocols**

#### 2. Automatic Liquidity Creation at Graduation (Raydium CPMM Only)
- If no liquidity pool exists for the token on Raydium at **graduation (target Milestone completion)**, flipflop.plus’s smart contract **automatically creates a SOL/token trading pair** and injects initial liquidity.
- **Funding Source**:
  - SOL from **Token Vault** (minting fees).
  - Tokens from **Token Vault** (e.g., 20% of total supply).
- **LP Token Handling**:
  - **Default Burned**: Ensures no one can withdraw liquidity funds.
  - Optionally retained by **Value Manager (VM)** for ongoing liquidity management.

#### 3. Manual Liquidity Addition for Other DEXs
- For liquidity on **Orca, Jupiter, etc.**, community or project teams must **manually add** it.
- flipflop.plus does **not automatically create pools** on these platforms, but tokens remain tradable.

**Summary**:
| DEX | Support Status | Liquidity Creation Method |
|-----|----------------|---------------------------|
| Raydium (CPMM) | ✅ Primary Support | Smart contract auto-creation at graduation |
| Orca | ✅ Supported | Manual addition required |
| Jupiter | ✅ Supported (aggregate trading) | Relies on underlying DEX liquidity |
| Other Solana DEXs | ✅ Supported | Manual addition required |

---

### F3. Is the Liquidity Pool Automatically Created at Graduation? How Many Tokens and Funds Enter It?
flipflop.plus **automatically creates a liquidity pool on Raydium** at **graduation (target Milestone completion)** if none exists. Rules:

#### 1. Is the Liquidity Pool Auto-Created?
✅ **Yes, default auto-creation** (Raydium only).
- **Trigger Condition**: If no SOL/token trading pair exists on Raydium at Milestone completion, the smart contract:
  1. Creates a **SOL/token pair** (e.g., SOL/FFP).
  2. Injects **initial liquidity** from Token Vault.
  3. Pays ~0.2 SOL for CPMM pool creation from Token Vault.
- **If a pool already exists**: No duplicate creation occurs.

#### 2. How Many Tokens and Funds Enter the Pool?
Initial liquidity comes from **Token Vault**, with amounts determined by the issuer or liquidity manager.

> **Note**: Actual SOL and token amounts may vary slightly due to refunds, URC reward deductions, etc.

#### 3. LP Token Handling
- **Optional Retention**: Issuer can delegate **Value Manager (VM)** to retain LP Tokens for future liquidity adjustments (e.g., market-making strategies).

#### 4. Why 20% Liquidity Ratio?
- **Sufficient Depth**: 20% tokens + corresponding SOL provide reasonable trading depth, reducing slippage.
- **Anti-Manipulation**: Prevents low liquidity ratios that make prices easily manipulable.
- **Remaining Tokens**: 80% distributed via minting (consensus + growth periods).

---

### F4. Is the Liquidity Pool Locked?
flipflop.plus’s liquidity pool is **not automatically locked** (LP Tokens are not burned by default). The **issuer or Value Manager (VM)** decides whether to burn or retain LP Tokens.

#### 1. LP Token Handling Options
| Option | Action | Impact |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Burn | Issuer or VM burns LP Tokens | - Permanently locks liquidity, preventing withdrawal.<br>- Builds community trust, avoiding rug pull risks. |
| Retain | VM manages LP Tokens for dynamic liquidity adjustments (e.g., market-making, mitigating impermanent loss) | - Flexible response to market volatility, optimizing capital efficiency.<br>- Requires high trust in VM. |

#### 2. Design Intent
##### (1) Flexibility First
- **Adapts to Project Needs**:
  - **Meme Coins**: May burn LP Tokens for decentralization and anti-manipulation.
  - **Long-Term Ecosystems**: May retain LP Tokens for professional market-making or extreme market responses.
- **Value Manager (VM) Role**: Professional VMs stabilize markets by adjusting liquidity depth.

##### (2) Risk vs. Trust Balance
- **Burning LP Tokens**:
  - **Pros**: Fully decentralized, eliminates rug pull risks.
  - **Cons**: Loses liquidity control, unable to intervene in market crashes.
- **Retaining LP Tokens**:
  - **Pros**: Smooths price curves via liquidity adjustments.
  - **Cons**: Relies on VM’s integrity and expertise (Token Vault’s non-withdrawable design reduces VM malfeasance risk).

##### (3) Community Governance Path
- Potential **DAO voting** with a multisig account as VM, allowing token holders to decide market management and LP Token handling (e.g., partial burn or retention).

##### (4) AI Agent
- Exploring **AI Agent** feasibility for market value management.

#### 3. Why Not Force Locking Like Other Platforms?
- **Avoids Rigidity**: Forced locking limits adaptability to market changes (e.g., adding liquidity during FUD).
- **Trust vs. Efficiency Trade-Off**:
  - flipflop.plus prioritizes **“code constraints + flexible governance”** over rigid rules.
  - Transparent VM operations (on-chain fund movement records) reduce trust costs.
- **Core Design**: Balances decentralized trust with market efficiency, empowering human decision-making.

### F5. Who Can Manage Assets in the Token Vault?
flipflop.plus’s **Token Vault** (project treasury) uses a **multi-tier permission system** for secure and transparent asset management. Rules:

#### 1. Management Permissions
| Role | Permission Scope | Operation Restrictions |
|------|------------------|-----------------------|
| Smart Contract | Auto-executes fund allocation (e.g., liquidity injection at graduation) | Fully decentralized, no human interference |
| Issuer | Can designate **Value Manager (VM)** but **cannot directly access funds** | Limited to smart contract rule-based actions (e.g., VM authorization) |
| Value Manager (VM) | If authorized, manages liquidity (e.g., market-making) but **cannot withdraw or transfer funds** | Funds restricted to on-chain liquidity operations (e.g., DEX add/remove), fully transparent |
| Community Governance (Future) | Planned DAO voting for major fund usage decisions (e.g., VM changes) | Not yet implemented, requires governance token |
| AI Agent (Future) | Planned AI-driven fund management and transaction execution | Under evaluation |

#### 2. Fund Security Design
- **Token Vault as PDA Account**:
  - No private key control; only accessible via **flipflop.plus smart contract**.
  - Prevents direct withdrawals by issuer or VM.
- **Restricted Fund Usage**:
  - Limited to **liquidity management** (e.g., Raydium add/remove) or **refund processing**.
  - No transfers to personal wallets or other contracts.

#### 3. Value Manager (VM) Duties and Constraints
- **Duties**:
  - Adjusts liquidity based on market conditions (e.g., countering crashes or volatility).
  - Executes issuer-defined market-making strategies (e.g., tiered liquidity injection).
- **Constraints**:
  - **24-Hour Trading Limit**: Issuer can set VM’s daily max operation amount to prevent overreach.
  - **Emergency Freeze**: Issuer or future DAO can vote to suspend VM permissions if malfeasance is detected.

#### 4. Design Intent
- **Decentralization vs. Control Balance**:
  - Issuers cannot arbitrarily manipulate funds but can optimize markets via professional VMs.
  - VM permissions are restricted to prevent centralized abuse.
- **Transparent Operations**:
  - All fund movements are recorded on-chain (e.g., via Solscan).
  - Community can monitor VM compliance.

---

### F6. Can Token Vault Funds Be Used During the Consensus Period? When Are They Accessible?
#### 1. During Consensus Period (Before Target Milestone)
- **❌ Unavailable**:
  - **Token Vault** funds (minting fees + tokens) are **fully frozen**, used only for:
    - **Refund Processing**: Funds are deducted and returned if users refund.
  - **No Access**: Issuer, VM, or platform cannot use funds.

#### 2. Fund Access Trigger Conditions
✅ **Available only after target Milestone completion (graduation)**, released per rules:
1. **Liquidity Injection**:
   - VM decides to inject Token Vault’s SOL minting fees + tokens into Raydium for pool creation.
2. **Post-Graduation Minting Fee Allocation**:
   - Fees continue entering Token Vault but can be used by **VM** for:
     - Adding liquidity.
     - Countering market volatility (e.g., buying during crashes).

#### 3. Design Intent
- **User Fund Safety**: Locking funds during consensus ensures refund availability, preventing issuer misuse.
- **Decentralized Launch**: Pre-graduation relies on community-driven trading; post-graduation uses smart contracts for fund allocation, minimizing human intervention.

**Summary**:
| Phase | Fund Status | Usable Scenarios |
|-------|-------------|------------------|
| Consensus Period | ❌ Frozen | Refund processing only |
| Post-Graduation | ✅ Unlocked | Auto liquidity injection + VM-managed funds |

### F7. How to Authorize a Third-Party Value Manager (VM) to Operate the Liquidity Wallet?
**Steps**:
1. **Access Management Page**:
   - Log into flipflop.plus website or app, go to **Menu → Tools → My Deployment**.
2. **Select Token**:
   - Locate the token to manage and enter its details page.
3. **Set Value Manager (VM)**:
   - Click **Authority**, enter the VM’s Solana wallet address in the **“Delegate Value Manager Account”** field.
4. **Confirm Authorization**:
   - Connect issuer wallet, sign the transaction to complete authorization.

**Notes**:
- **Default VM**: Issuer’s address unless changed manually.
- Post-authorization, VM can manage liquidity but **cannot withdraw funds**, limited to pool operations.

---

### F8. Can Issuers Designate a VM During Consensus or Issuance Periods?
**Yes, issuers can designate a Value Manager (VM) at any time**:
1. **Authorization Timing**:
   - **Consensus Period**: Set or change VM via the **Authority** page.
   - **Issuance Period (Post-Graduation)**: Adjust VM with a new signed transaction.
2. **Default Setting**:
   - If not specified, the **issuer’s wallet address** is the default VM.
3. **Operation Restrictions**:
   - VM is limited to liquidity management (e.g., DEX market-making) and **cannot withdraw Token Vault funds**.

---

### F9. How Are Tokens in the Token Vault Obtained?
#### 1. Token Source
Tokens in the Token Vault are generated via a **pre-minting mechanism**:
- **Initial Supply**: Set per token type (Standard=100M, Meme=1B).
- **Pre-Mint Allocation**:
  - **100%** deposited into **Mint Token Vault** for user minting and liquidity distribution.

#### 2. Calculation
- **Liquidity Tokens (20%):**  
  - For each user mint, **Mint Token Vault** airdrops tokens to the user and Token Vault simultaneously, where:
  - **Token Vault Token Amount**:
    $$
    \text{TokenVault Tokens} = \frac{\text{User Minted Tokens}}{1 - \text{Liquidity Ratio (20\%)}
    $$

---

### F10. How Is SOL Obtained in the Token Vault?
#### 1. SOL Source
All SOL in the Token Vault comes from **user **minting fees**fees, after deducting:
1. **Protocol Fee (5%)**: Fixed deduction for platform maintenance.
2. **URC Referral Rewards (0–5%)**: Deducted if a referral code, per rules (up to 5%) was used.

#### 2. Calculation Formula
```
Stored SOL = User Minting Fee - Protocol Fee (5%) – URC Reward (0–5%)
```
- **Example** (Standard mode, single mint fee 0.2 SOL):
  - **No URC**: `0.2 SOL - 0.01 SOL (5%) = 0.19 SOL` stored in Vault.
  - **With URC (3% reward)**: `0.2 SOL - 0.01 SOL - (0.006%) SOL = (0.1843% SOL) stored in Vault.

---

### F11. Can Assets Be Withdrawn from the Token Vault?
No.

---

### F12. How Can Token Vault Assets Be Used?
#### 1. Permitted Operations
Token Vault assets (SOL + tokens) are **restricted** to liquidity management:
1. **Add Liquidity**:
   - Inject SOL and SOL tokens into DEXs (e.g., Raydium) to create/expand pools.
2. **Remove Liquidity**:
   - Withdraw liquidity from DEXs (e.g., for market-making strategies,, depth tuning).
3. **Buy Tokens**:
   - Use SOL to buy tokens on the market (e.g., for price support or buyback-and-burn).
4. **Sell Tokens**:
   - Sell tokens for SOL to (e.g., hedge sell pressure or balance funds).
   5. **Burn LP Tokens**:
     - Destroy liquidity credentials to permanently lock liquidity, preventing withdrawal.

#### 2. Prohibited Actions
- ❌ Withdraw to personal wallets
- ❌ Transfer to non-contract-authorized addresses
- ❌ Use for non-liquidity-related expenses

#### 3. Execution Conditions
- **Issuer/VM Operation**: Performed via flipflop.plus smart contract, with all transactions on-chain traceable.
- **Smart Contract Control**: Only supports the above 5 operation functions; other actions are rejected.

#### 4. Design Intent
- **Dedicated Funding**: Ensures 100% of funds serve liquidity, eliminating misuse risk.
- **Decentralized Oversight**: All operations are transparent, verifiable by the community via blockchain explorers.

---

### F13. How Is Token Vault Fund Safety Ensured Technically?
The Token Vault is a **PDA account**, owned by the Solana program itself, ensuring no one can alter its balance.

#### 1. PDA Account (Program Derived Address)
- **No Private Key**: Token Vault is a smart contract-generated PDA with no private key, inaccessible via external signatures.
- **Sole Permission**: Only the **flipflop.plus smart contract** can interact with the account; humans or other contracts cannot.

#### 2. Smart Contract Hardcoded Rules
- Funds are restricted only to the following on-chain operations (via preset functions):
  -1. **Liquidity management** (add/remove DEX liquidity).
  -2. **Market operations** (buy/sell tokens).
  -3. **LP token burning**.
  -4. **Refund processing**.
- **Any other transfer or withdrawal requests** are automatically rejected.

#### 3. On-Chain Transparency
- All fund movements are recorded on the Solana blockchain, publicly verifiable (e.g., via Solana.eth Solscan).
- Community can monitor **Token Vault balance** balance** and **operation history** in real-time.
- Community can monitor-time Token **Vault** balance and operation history.

#### 4. Security Boundaries
- **Physical Isolation**: Even the flipflop.plus team cannot access funds; control is code-only.
- **Anti-Attack Design**: Contracts audited, critical functions (e.g., fund transfers) have multiple validations.

**Summary**:  
**PDA account + Smart contract whitelisting + Full-chain transparency** ensure funds are **“usable but unstealable”**.

---

### F14. How Can Issuers Prevent Value Manager (VM) Malfeasance?
flipflop.plus uses a **dual-risk-control mechanism** to prevent VM misuse, ensuring fund safety:

#### 1. Emergency Freeze
- **Immediate Effect**:  
  issuers can instantly **freeze VM permissions** via the **Authority** page, halting all operations.
- **Applicable Scenarios**:
  - VM with unusual transactions (e.g., frequent liquidity removals).
- Community votes to challenge VM behavior (future DAO governance).

#### 2. 24-Hour Transaction Limits
- **Quota Control**:  
  issuers can set a **daily fund operation cap** for VMs (e.g., max $10% of vault SOL per day).
- **Trigger Block**:  
  smart contracts attempts exceeding the limit are automatically rejected.

#### 3. Design Intent
- **Power Balance**:
  - VMs can professionally manage liquidity, but issuers retain emergency override.
- **Risk Mitigation**:  
  limits prevent significant single-incident losses.

---

### F15. Who Is the Default Value Manager (VM)?
The issuer.

---

### F16. How Can a VM View All Managed Tokens?
**Steps**:
1. **Log into Flipflop.plus**:
   - Access the app or website, connect the VM’s authorized Solana wallet.
2. **Navigate to Token Management**:
   - Go to **Menu → Token Management → Delegated Tokens**.
3. **View Token List**:
   - Displays **all tokens authorized to this VM**, including token name, token ID, balance, and liquidity status, and ID.

**Notes**:
- Only tokens **explicitly delegated** to the VM’s address are visible.
- Ensure wallet address matches the issuer-authorized VM address.

---

### F17. What If the Community Fears Endless Minting Post-Graduation? How to Stop Minting?
#### **Solution**: Burn Mint Token Vault
**Steps**:
1. **Initiate Burn**:
   - Issuer or VM uses **flipflop.plus smart contract**:
     - Navigate to **Menu → Token Management → Delegated Tokens**, select token.
     - Click **Burn Mint Token**, enter quantity to vault**, and confirm with gas fees.
   - **Effect**: Destroys specified unburned tokens in the **Mint Token Vault**.
2. **Prerequisites**:
   - Token must have **completed target Milestone** (graduated); otherwise, wait for graduation.
   - Burning **does not affect circulating tokens**, which remain tradable.

**Example**:  
A Meme coin with a 1B total supply minted 250M tokens. The community votes to burn the remaining 750M, stopping minting, fixing the total supply at 250M.
