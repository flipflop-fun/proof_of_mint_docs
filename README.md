## 🎯 What is Proof of Mint (PoM)?

**Proof of Mint (PoM)** is an innovative decentralized token minting mechanism designed to address fairness and security issues in traditional token issuance.

### 🌟 Core Features

- **🛡️ Anti-Sybil Attack**: Dynamic difficulty adjustment prevents malicious batch minting
- **⚖️ Fair Distribution**: Ensures fair token distribution, avoiding early concentrated minting
- **🔄 Dynamic Adjustment**: Bitcoin-like mining difficulty adjustment mechanism
- **💰 Liquidity Guarantee**: Smart liquidity management and guarantee mechanism
- **🔒 Zero-Risk Participation**: Full refund support before milestone achievement

### 🆚 Differences from Other Platforms

Compared to platforms like pump.fun, PoM provides:
- More fair token distribution mechanism
- Stronger security guarantees
- Better community consensus building time
- More comprehensive participant protection
